# How Diffusion Models Work - Lecture 3

This repository contains materials for Lecture 3 of the "How Diffusion Models Work" series, presented by deeplearning.ai.

## Acknowledgments

- Sprites by ElvGames, [FrootsnVeggies](https://zrghr.itch.io/froots-and-veggies-culinary-pixels) and [kyrise](https://kyrise.itch.io/).  
- This code is modified from [minDiffusion GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloneofsimo/minDiffusion).
- The diffusion model is based on the concepts presented in the papers "[Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)" and "[Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502)".

## Overview

This lecture provides an in-depth look at diffusion models, specifically focusing on their application and theory. It leverages sprites and illustrations from ElvGames, FrootsnVeggies, and kyrise to explain complex concepts in an accessible and visually engaging manner.
